https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timeswire-product/1/overview

Generate an API key - https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started

## Requirements

* Create an endless scrolling article browser, the articles should be shown in order of recency

* Each article should display the Title, Published Date (in MM/DD/YYYY),
Image if it exists, and an abstract of the article. Don't worry about how the article looks! As long as it's readable we're not looking for designers.

* If you click on the article it opens the article in a new page in web browser

* Bottom navigation for the following sections:
  * All, World, Business, Art
  * Bonus: A dropdown that browses through the entire [list of sections](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timeswire-product/1/routes/content/section-list.json/get)

* The app works in both portrait and landscape mode
